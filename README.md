# ⚠️ Repository is archived

Hi! This repository has been archived since 2023 with the hopes to port it upstream, to space-wizards/space-station-14. We never did, but if you'd like to, a lot of the minigame code is well written and can be easily moved upstream.

StationWare is a fork of SS14 primarily focused on WarioWare-like gameplay and general wackiness.
