As a NRP server, this is the the most plain version of the Space Station 14 rules you can get. If you act with common sense, you won't be banned.

[color=#a4885c]0.[/color] [color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Admins may excercise discretion with rules as they see fit. If you rule lawyer or line skirt, you will get removed. Admins will answer for use of this privilege.

[color=#ff0000]ZERO TOLERANCE RULES[/color]
Violation of any of these rules will result in an immediate permanent ban.

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Absolutely no hate speech, slurs, bigotry, IC specism (demeaning other characters in-game due to their in-game race), or anything even remotely similar.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Absolutely no Erotic Roleplay (ERP) or sexual content, including direct or indirect mentions of sexual behavior or actions. (Leeway is given to insults, ex: 'You are a dickhead', do not push it)

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Attempting to evade game bans will result in an automatic appeal-only permanent ban that is only appealable after six months. Attempting to evade job bans will result in an appeal-only permanent ban. (YOU WILL GET BANNED MUCH WORSE THAN YOU ALREADY WERE)

[color=#ff0000]GENERAL ETIQUETTE[/color]

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] These are English servers. Speak only English in chat.

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Be kind. Don't excessively insult, demean, or harass other players. If you believe someone else's conduct breaks these rules, please inform admins.

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Don't use exploits or external programs while playing in order to gain an advantage or disrupt the round/server. This includes autoclickers and auto-hotkey scripts.

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] Don't utilize multiple accounts while playing. Users knowingly using multiple SS14 accounts will have all of their accounts banned.

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Don't ignore the admin help relay, abuse it by flooding it with garbage, check for admins before stating a problem (ex: "hello?", "any admins?"), or send messages of no substance. All admin helps are relayed to the StationWare Discord.
