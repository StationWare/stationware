      ** Applications of Botanical Specimens Found In Nanotrasen Territories **

      Many plants, when ground, yield useful chemicals. S. (spessmens) papaver and S. aloe vera
      are known for their basic healing properties.

      S. lucidum, or lingzhi, is known for its potent ability to save those near death from toxins. Eating too much
      is known to cause adverse effects.

      S. amanita, a powerfully poisonous specimen (Rest In Peace Sir Alacaster), and S. galactica, a
      seemingly ordinary antitoxin, appear to have some sort of relation to eachother.

      Some research is being done on combinations of the medicinal plants discussed, and they may prove fruitful.

      CHAPTER 1: SMALL ADVENTURES IN A BIG STATION

      This station is filled with crime and grime...

      I was shooting hoops down on Bagel when I heard a cry and a laser shot. I walked under the table nearby to hide, but there wasn't a second shot.

      Outside, the engineerin chief got blasted by two Syndies hooked up with some fierce contraband. There wasn't enough of him for an open casket funeral.

      Things always go wild here.. I'll never look at clowns the same.

      The question is.. Who did it?
